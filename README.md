# Fallproof

This is the project developed in less than 28 hours at [HackForGood 2018](https://gulbenkian.pt/hackforgood) by Deathdrop team.

The objective is to monitor elderly people with a smart wristlet and alert relatives, through a mobile application, if something is wrong with the wearable user (for example if he/she fell). Besides this primary usage, data collected can be further used to improve a machine learning algorithm to better detect false positives as well as by researchers to detect patterns in some diseases and help preventing them.
